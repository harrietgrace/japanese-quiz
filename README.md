#japanese-quiz is a super simple web app for improving Japanese vocabulary. 

It's very basic at the moment, but I'll be adding functionality over the next few months. 

##A rather messy outline of the plans:

Space to display character, sentence, word etc
Changes class based on what is being displayed

KANJI LEARNING
text boxes to input pronounciation(either roomaji or hiragana) and english meaning

WORD LEARNING
text box to input english meaning

SENTENCE LEARNING
text area to input english meaning

HOW
Library of kanji with meanings and pronounciation, words and meanings, setences with meanings
Choose on the home page what combination of the above that you want
Pull out of a db, display image

When focus is in the pronounciation box, popup hiragana keyboard (use a map or something?)

Check answers against stored ones
If correct display a tick
If incorrect, display the meaning/pronounciation

If correct then put in limbo for 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 3 weeks, 2 months (Put a counter on it, if it's not 0, then it's in limbo for however long the counter is, will reinsert itself when it is 0. Need separate counter for how many times it's been right)
