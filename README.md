##japanese-quiz is a work in progress web app for improving Japanese vocabulary. 

This app will eventually have similar functionality to the leaarning website memrise. It will be more basic, this is a personal project for learning purposes. 
It's *very* basic at the moment, but I'll be adding functionality as I can. 

####A general outline of the plans:

Space to display character, sentence, word etc
Changes class based on what is being displayed

KANJI LEARNING
text boxes to input pronounciation(either roomaji or hiragana) and english meaning

WORD LEARNING
text box to input english meaning

SENTENCE LEARNING
text area to input english meaning

HOW
Library of kanji with meanings and pronounciation, words and meanings, setences with meanings
Choose on the home page what combination of the above that you want
Pull out of a db, display image

When focus is in the pronounciation box, popup hiragana keyboard

Check answers against stored ones
If correct display a tick
If incorrect, display the meaning/pronounciation

If correct then put in limbo for 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 3 weeks, 2 months
