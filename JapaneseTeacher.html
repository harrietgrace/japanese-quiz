Library of kanji with meanings and pronounciation, words and meanings, setences with meanings
Choose on the home page what combination of the above that you want
Pull out of a db, display image

When focus is in the pronounciation box, popup hiragana keyboard (use a map or something?)

Check answers against stored ones
If correct display a tick
If incorrect, display the meaning/pronounciation

If correct then put in limbo for 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 3 weeks, 2 months (Put a counter on it, if it's not 0, then it's in limbo for however long the counter is, will reinsert itself when it is 0. Need separate counter for how many times it's been right)-->
